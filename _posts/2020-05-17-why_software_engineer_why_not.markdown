For three years now I wanted to make a career switch from being an early childhood educator. It took one year to have the courage to even consider a career change after fifteen years in the education industry. Then another to look into the options that allow me to have more time and flexibility and increase my hope for a work-life-balance (does it exist?). After two years of more thinking and talking myself out of that imposter syndrome, my son made his appearance and that's when I told myself I need to stop thinking and start doing (motivation, yeah!).  

My husband is in the tech industry and by chance I met some of his co-workers who were employed as Scrum Masters at his company. I couldn't help but giggle at the title "Scrum Master" but my curiosity got the best of me and I went down the rabbit hole of "googling" their job. Fast forward, I found myself attending a two-day course to be certified as a "Scrum Master." Why? Oh why not? Who doesn't want that cool title on the top of their LinkedIn profile? I was an Instructional Coach who worked with teachers to help sharpen their teaching practices. My coaching skills would've totally transferred into my potentially new role, Scrum Master, or so I thought. Fast forward to 6 months, 113 applications, and 0 responses, I've decided that it's time to make my appearance in the tech industry through one of their most popular positions, Software Engineer. So here I am two weeks into this incredibly challenging coding boot camp that stomped on my confidence at the same time giving me an extreme amount of adrenaline when I accomplished a lab all by myself (j/k, I used the Ask A Question).
