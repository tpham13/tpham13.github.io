For my Rails Project at Flatiron School, I created a Behavior Log App where caregivers (i.e. parents, teachers, grandparents) can track their kid/kids behaviors (i.e. tantrums) to help them see a pattern of repeated behaviors and their causes.

The following are the steps that I took to set this up.
