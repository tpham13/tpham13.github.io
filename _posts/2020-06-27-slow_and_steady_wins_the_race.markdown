My first CLI project was my worst nightmare (okay, maybe not worst, but close enough) and I was on my own! Although I slightly understood each lesson leading up to this project, I had no idea how to put everything together. Starting the project was hard and not very encouraging because even after six weeks of the coding bootcamp, I couldn't even start writing a single piece of code. I was caught in a paralysis. So, my solution was to avoid writing the code and started doodling the flow of the project and soon I was able to visualize it. I used the google drawio like Learn recommended to sketch a chart of my CLI project. In many ways, this was very beneficial because as I was working on the chart I realized that at a high-level, I do understand how the classes and methods would work together. 

It took me 10 days to complete the CLI project. Every day I wrote a few lines of code, then tested them to see if they worked and when they did work, I wrote a few more. I wasn't sure how I was going to scrape the website I chose, Philz Coffee, and scraping just seemed so intimidating. So, I used my chart to write some skeleton code (naming my class and methods) for the four classes that I would have: scraper, coffees, coffee_blends, and cli. Writing the skeleton code out helped me outline what I should be looking for in my scraper and once the scraper class is done, I could start connecting it to other classes. Another solution that helped me complete this project was asking not being afraid to seek out help if I got stuck. I used every resource at my disposal including Google, friends, colleagues, my cohort lead, and finally attending every open office hours that were available. The biggest lesson I learned during this CLI project was to just start writing a few lines of code and everything else will come along.
