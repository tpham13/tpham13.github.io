This project is especially exciting for me to be able to work on an dynamic web application. I created an app for parents to add different toys with purchase link to the web application. I kept it simple and only added two models to this project: toy and toy category. I also used serializer to help organize the data. I find it easier to navigate my data with serializer. 

Some of the biggest challenges of this project is fetching for data. I learned that console log and debugger are my friend during this project as I always have to know what data I am getting and where the data is located. Another challenge is fetching for data. It was very exciting to see the data show up on the browser. 

Overall, the project was challenging but it's a great preparation for the final one.
