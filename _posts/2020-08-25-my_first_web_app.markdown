Once again, Flatiron challenged us to put together everything we learn into a project. After every project that I have completed, I felt like I've gained a better understanding of everything that I've learned in the curriculum. At the start, I was very excited about the fact that I'm going to build a usable web application. Then one-third of the way into the project, the imposter syndrome hits hard and that mental block is hard to break. I attended the open office hours, scheduled multiple 1:1 with the instructor, and this last one, reaching out to colleagues via the Slack channel was out of my comfort zone but also the best way for me to learn. 


In my profession, I provide instructional coaching to teachers who work with children ages 0 to 5. During my coaching years, I had help teachers come up with many different ways to document children's behaviors.  The trouble is keeping track of all these documentations in various forms like paper and excel sheets. Often time, teachers forget or give up on these documentations due to their busy schedules. So, I thought, what better way to help teachers keep track of all these documentation in one place. Then the creation of the Behavior Log web application was born. 

Just like how I handle my everyday excitements, I dived in and gave everything I got for this project. I thought having multiple models (user, kid, behavior logs) would be a piece of cake but turned out that piece of cake was too big and I need to slice a smaller one (and save that big piece of cake for sometime after the Sinatra project is due). Coding is like anything in life, starting with big ambition might not always work out but if I take a step back and target one thing at a time, I can celebrate those successes and keep building on to it.
